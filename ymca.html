							<h1>YMCA</h1>
							<p class="major">Local multiplayer game. Used Unity3D. 
									Made for the Global Game Jam in January 2018 with 3 other game programmers and 2 game designers in 48 hours. The theme was "Transmission".
									You control one of the character in the arena and you possess 4 skills. When you touch someone with a skill, you transmit it to him.
									The only way to win is to have no skill at all and run to the exit before someone give you any skill.

								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>We took a diversifier : YMCA of the village people. Hence the name of the game "You Must Convey Abilities". 
									The characters are also based on the village people. About the concept of the game, I was not in the team yet when it was decided so I just followed the flow.</p>

								<h2>My work</h2>
								<p>Since we were 4 programmers (with the last one was doing art assets), I was tasked with doing the skill architecture and its transmission. 
									There was already some work done when I joined but needed heavy rework. I also developed the gun skill and a ray skill, with the ray not put in the final game.</p>
