							<h1>Cop Academy</h1>
							<p class="major">VR (HTC Vive) Party Game in the cop universe. 
									Used Unity3D and SteamVR. Produced with another game programmer and 3 game designers as a school project of 4 months. 
									I produced 4 mini games and worked on the initial structure used for the overall management of the game.</p>

								<h2>My work</h2>
								<p>At the beginning of the project, I proposed and worked on the flow of the game with an architecture allowing changes on anything without impacting what 
									should not be impacted (example : changing how the mini games are played will not impact the global flow of a party in any way).
									I've developed several mini games : a shooting stand, a hot-cold game with a distributor, playing as a CRS member with a stick and a shield, 
									and lastly a game where you follow the instructions of the informatic service to repair your computer.</p>

								<h2>Example of a VR problem</h2>
								<p>The game with the distributor involved a problem : the fact that I wanted a precise point. 
									Since both the colliders of the distributor and the objects you have in hand are kinematic, I had to change one of them in a trigger.
									The most obvious choice was the object held in the hand since it can also move other things. So I had to make the distributor's faces' colliders
									as triggers. But then you don't have contact point, and I resolved it by projecting the closest point of the object to the face on the distributor 
									and this several times (like 10 times) to get a point close enough to the real contact point. The thing is such problem occurs often with VR.</p>
