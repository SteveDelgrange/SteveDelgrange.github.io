								<h2>Background</h2>
								<p>As a 4th year student of RUBIKA, I had to present a concept for the projects of 5th year. My concept was Make The Hero. 
									To make it there, I had to make a prototype as a proof of concept. I was with a game designer and a game artist, who 
									were mostly working on the presentation. I still received some models and textures for the prototype like the swords. It was a success.

								<h2>My work on Gameplay</h2>
								<p>As the game is in VR, most of the time is spent on interactions and fixing bugs (like hands disappear when destroying held objects). 
									Make The Hero is also a RPG with crafting, so I created a RPG system with a simple AI and a crafting system with recipes based on steps such as "Hammered" or "Tempered".
									Everything is still in a "Work In Progress" state, especially since we want to be sure to not implement something breaking everything else and so we go on carefully.

									<li><a href="#third" class="button big wide smooth-scroll-middle">About the VR</a></li>

								<h2>VR</h2>
								<p>VR allows a more immersive experience, but is quite hard to get things working, especially when playing with collisions like when hammering on an anvil. 
									That's why choosing the good tools is a priority. As such, we went from SteamVR v.1 to SteamVR v.2 and finally VRTK, an enormous toolbox for VR allowing 
									us to export the game on more hardwares and with many cool features like object in hand colliding with things and not entering them.
